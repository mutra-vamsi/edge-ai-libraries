Description: ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) - development files
 The ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature extractor consists
 of various CV kernels such as resize, gaussian, fast, compute descriptor
 and orientation while non CV functions like distribute_keypoints_via_tree.
 .
 This package contains development files (headers and samples).
