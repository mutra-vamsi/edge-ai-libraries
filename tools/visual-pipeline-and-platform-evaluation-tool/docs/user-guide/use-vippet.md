# How To Use ViPPET

The [gvapython modules article](./how-to-guides/use-gvapython-scripts.md) explains how to
add user-defined Python scripts that can be loaded as modules by the `gvapython` element.

The [video generator article](./how-to-guides/use-video-generator.md) explains how to
use the video generator to create composite videos from images stored in subdirectories.

The [pipeline configuration article](./how-to-guides/configure-pipelines.md) explains step-by-step how to configure
and test AI pipelines using ViPPET's Pipeline Builder, from creating a new pipeline, editing the pipeline elements,
to demonstrating running pipelines on both CPU and GPU to compare performance.

The [performance testing article](./how-to-guides/performance-testing.md) covers performance testing of single pipelines
as well as multiple pipelines running concurrently.
